# Java Object-Oriented Programming & Core Java Concepts

Welcome to my comprehensive repository dedicated to mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and essential **core Java** concepts. This repository serves as a detailed learning journal where I document theory, practical examples, design patterns, and hands-on projects to build a solid foundation in Java programming.

## 🔍 Overview

This repository covers fundamental and advanced topics in Java with a strong focus on OOP principles and related language features. It is designed to support continuous learning and serve as a reference for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable Java code.

Every concept or example includes:

- ✅ Clean, readable, and optimized Java code  
- 🧠 Thorough explanation of the concept or pattern  
- 💡 Step-by-step breakdown of the logic and implementation  
- 📝 Notes on best practices, common pitfalls, and edge cases
