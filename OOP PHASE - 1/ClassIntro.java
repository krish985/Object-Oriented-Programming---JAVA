        // Now what you can do think thier is no way to store all of this thing into
        // single unit.
        // here's the class come into the picture.

        // you can store all data into single unit.
        // Not only data you can store methods it means function.
        // suppose you write a function that greet .
        // you can say class is a custom data type where devloper can create along with
        // their requirement.

        // See line Number 2.
